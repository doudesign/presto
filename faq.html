        <p>The following page is a collection of frequently asked questions about the Presto project. If you don't
        find the question or answer you are looking for send a question to the Presto Google Group or ask your
        question on either Stack Overlow or IRC.  For more information about our community resources,

        <h2>How does Presto work?</h2>

        <p>
            The client sends SQL to the Presto coordinator. The coordinator
            parses, analyzes, and plans the query execution. The scheduler wires
            together the execution pipeline, assigns work to nodes closest to the
            data , and monitors progress. The client pulls data from output
            stage, which in turn pulls data from underlying stages.

        <h2>What backend storage providers does Presto support?</h2>

        <p>
            During the initial phase of the project, we realized that
            large data sets were being stored in many other systems in
            addition to HDFS.  Some data stores are well-­‐known
            systems such as HBase, but others are custom systems such
            as the Facebook News Feed backend.  Presto was designed
            with a simple storage abstraction that makes it easy to
            provide SQL query capability against these disparate data
            sources.  In addition to the primary Hive/HDFS backend, we
            have built Presto connectors to several other systems,
            including HBase, Scribe, and other custom systems.
        </p>

            </a>
        </p>

        <p>
            Extensibility is a key design point for Presto which is
            why we've developed a storage plugin API so that users can
            integrate Presto with existing sources of data.  Storage
            plugins (called connectors) only need to provide
            interfaces for fetching metadata, getting data locations,
            and accessing the data itself.
        </p>


        <h2>Why did the Presto Project choose Java?</h2>

        <p>
            The Presto system is implemented in Java because it’s fast
            to develop, has a great ecosystem, and is easy to
            integrate with the rest of the data infrastructure
            components at Facebook that are primarily built in Java.
            Presto dynamically compiles certain portions of the query
            plan down to bytecode which lets the JVM optimize and
            generate native machine code.  Through careful use of
            memory and data structures, Presto avoids typical issues
            of Java code related to memory allocation and garbage
            collection.  (In a later post, we will share some tips and
            tricks for writing high-­‐performance Java system code and
            the lessons learned while building Presto.)
        </p>

        <h2>What is the Roadmap for Presto?</h2>

        <p>
            We are actively working on extending Presto functionality
            and improving performance.  In the next few months, we
            will remove restrictions on join and aggregation sizes and
            introduce the ability to write output tables.  We are also
            working on a query “accelerator” by designing a new data
            format that is optimized for query processing and avoids
            unnecessary transformations.  This feature will allow hot
            subsets of data to be cached from backend data store, and
            the system will transparently use cached data to
            “accelerate” queries.  We are also working on a high
            performance HBase connector.</p>
